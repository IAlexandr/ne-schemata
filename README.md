GraphQL IDL/Schemata String class to make working with GraphQL easier

## Overview

Working with Schemata (Schema Definition Language), sometimes called IDL (Interface Definition Language) can occasionally be difficult. A schema definition is the most concise way to specify a schema in GraphQL.

Classes in programming languages are data structures that associated properties and functions designed to work with them. The provided `Schemata` class extends String and should be able to be used in most places in JavaScript where strings are used with no changes. This, however, is where things change.

Some of the most often applied tasks with SDL are building a schema object, building an executable schema object, parsing it into [`ASTNode`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/language/ast.js#L88) objects. Occasionally a given bit of SDL is checked for validity.

The Schemata class does all this and more.

## Features

Biggest selling points of working with the Schemata class

- [x] Creation of bound or non-bound [`GraphQLSchema`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/schema.js#L48) and [`ASTNode`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/language/ast.js#L88) object
- [x] Storage of an associated `resolvers` map
- [x] Storage of an associated `schema` object for iteration and modification
- [x] Checking of the validity of SDL as a [`ASTNode`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/language/ast.js#L88) as well as a [`GraphQLSchema`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/type/schema.js#L48)
- [x] Merge SDL together via AST parsing
- [x] Merge multple GraphQLSchemas via AST parsing
- [x] Pare down one SDL/Schema using another as a guide

## Installation

Simply npm or yarn install the package

```sh
/Volumes/harddrive/path/to/your/project
$ npm install --save ne-schemata
```

## Usage

### Using `new`

Creating instances of Schemata can of course be done with typical JavaScript via the `new` keyword.

```js
let schemata = new Schemata('type Person { name: String } type Query { peep: Person }')
```

### Using `Schemata.from`

Creating instances of Schemata can also be done with a constant on the class itself called `.from()`.

```js
let schemata = Schemata.from('type Person { name: String } type Query { peep: Person }')
```

### From an existing instance of Schemata

Creating instances of Schemata from other instances of Schemata is also supported. In these cases, all the set values of note will be moved over. This includes schema and resolvers set on the original instance.

```js
let sdlA = Schemata.from(
  'type Person { name: String } type Query { peep: Person }',
  { Query: { peep() { return { name: 'Brielle' } } } }
)
let sdlB = Schemata.from(sdlA)

console.log(sdlB.resolvers) // { Query: { peep: [function peep()] } }
```

### From an instance of GraphQLSchema

You can also create a Schemata instance from an existing instance of GraphQLSchema. The typeDefs or SDL string will be generated using `printSchema()` from the base graphql module. The `.schema` value will be set explicitly to the value supplied in the case it is executable or has had other modifications performed on it. To prevent it being regenerated by `.executableSchema` should that property be accessed, a symbol property will be set on the schema to denote it should not be touched.

```js
import { makeRemoteExecutableSchema, introspectSchema } from 'graphql-tools';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

let link = new HttpLink({ uri: 'some uri', fetch })
let schema = makeRemoteExecutableSchema(await introspectSchema(link), link)
let schemata = new Schemata(schema) // or Schemata.from(schema)

console.log(schemata) // the SDL from the remote schema
```

### Using the `gql` template function

Alternatively, creating a Schemata string instance can be done using the `gql` template function. The function was named as many popular editors have a syntax highlighting theme that highlights GraphQL SDL. It seemed to make a lot of sense to add the resulting string from this as an instance of `Schemata`

```js
import { gql } from 'ne-schemata'

let schemata = gql`
  type Person {
    name: String
  }

  type Query {
    peep: Person
  }
`

let schema = schemata.schema
```

### Using require('file.graphql') with require extensions

The final way to create new instances of Schemata in a helpful and unobtrusive manner is to use the `'.graphql'` extension handler. This handler registers the `'.graphql'` extension with the `require()` function in your local nodeJS environment.

Once registered, `require()` and `import {} from` will now do several interesting things with `'.graphql'` imported text. First the resulting exported object has 5 different keys, with the default being a Schemata string wrapping the contents of the file itself.

The five exports of imported `'.graphql'` files are:

- [x] **astNode** an [`ASTNode`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/src/language/ast.js#L88) object representing the parsed contents of the file
- [x] **resolvers** *if* there is an adjacent .js file of the same name, *and if* that file exports `'resolvers'` *or if* the exported results are an object and not a function, then that object is considered to be a resolvers map for the associated `.graphql` file.
- [x] **schema** generated from the contents of the Schemata string. If the resolvers object was successfully generated and imported, this will be an executableSchema instead.
- [x] **sdl** the Schemata string instance, also the **default** export
- [x] **typeDefs** keeping in line and adding compatibility with Apollo Server, the `typeDefs` export is simply a synonym for `sdl`.

How do you use the extension? Somewhere, typically early on in the project entry script, make a call to `register()` and then subsequently `import/require` your `'.graphql'` files.

```js
require('ne-schemata/register')

import { sdl, schema, resolvers } from './graphql/Person.graphql'

// or alternatively
require('ne-schemata').register('graphql') // or simply register() as .graphql is the default

import { sdl, schema, resolvers } from './graphql/Person.graphql'
```

### Schemata Merging (both strings and GraphQLSchema objects)

AST merging of multiple SDL files and resolver maps. This will allow you to do something like the following. Merging schemas is just as easy. A new instance of GraphQLSchema will be created and stored on the instance but the pre-existing resolvers will be deeply merged with the supplied resolvers on the schema to be merged and all will be applied and bound to the newly generated schema.

```js
import graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql'
import Express from 'express'
import { gql } from 'ne-schemata'

const app = Express()
const sdlA = gql`type Person { name: String } type Query { peep: Person }`
const sdlB = gql`type Person { age: Int } type Query { peeps: [Person] }`
const sdlC = sdlA.mergeSDL(sdlB)

/*
sdlC.schema would evaluate to something like the following:

type Person {
  name: String
  age: Int
}

type Query {
  peep: Person
  peeps: [Person]
}
*/

app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema: sdlC.schema,
  graphiql: true
}))

app.listen(4000)
```

#### Merging Concerns

*TLDR; Schemata has your back and you don't really need to read this*

Still here? Cool, let's learn what happens during merging. When merging multiple schemas, one of the problems that can occur, especially if one of the schemas being merged is a remote executable schema, is that the resolvers might be bound to an older version of a schema that is only a subset of the new merge.

Schemata helps to alleviate this problem by introducing a few interfaces of note. The immediate solution to this problem is to wrap the resolvers and have those resolvers point to a newly merged GraphQLSchema object rather than the one it was originally bound to.

The problem comes in when you try to merge more than once. Wrapping a previously wrapped version of a resolver will allow you to set it at the top, but the previous attempt to do will execute and override the changes you just made.

Schemata solves this problem by storing the older unbound methods with each bind. A reference to the schema, sdl and resolvers at the time of the merge are kept. When each subsequent merge occurs, these older unwrapped/unbound resolvers are used to apply the new schema rather than layering things like Russian nesting dolls.

Furthermore, when making a call to `.mergeSchema()` you may add your own resolver injectors which are simply objects containing a property called `'.resolverInjectors'` which are an array of `ResolverArgsTransformer` functions. These give you full acceess to the `source`, `args`, `context` and `info` parameters to modify to your hearts content before the original unwrapped resolver receives those parameters.

```js
import { Schemata } from 'ne-schemata'

let a = Schemata.from(
  'type Query { me: String }',
  { me(s,a,c,i) { return 'Brielle' } }
)

let b = Schemata.from(
  'type Query { her: String }',
  { her(s,a,c,i) { return 'Stacy' } }
)

let ab = a.mergeSchema(b)

console.log(ab.prevMergeResolvers)
// [{schema:..., sdl:..., resolvers:...}, ...] <-- unwrapped
console.log(ab.resolvers)
// { me(), her() }     <-- wrapped to new schema

let c = Schemata.from(
  'type Polygon { sides: Int }',
  { Polygon: { sides(s,a,c,i) { return 6 } } }
)

let abc = ab.mergeSchema(c)
console.log(abc.prevMergeResolvers)
// [{schema:..., sdl:..., resolvers:...}, ...] <-- unwrapped
console.log(abc.resolvers)
// { me(), her(), Polygon: { sides() } } <-- wrapped to new schema
```

Even this example has difficulty explaining properly what is happening and why it's important, but as each merge happens the previous unwrapped resolvers are passed along and newly introduced schemas' resolvers are added to this list.

```
Schemata instances are versatile and can be created through a variety of sources. Typically anything that can be converted to a string of SDL can be used to create a new Schemata instance. Everything from a GraphQL `Source` instance, previously instantiated `Schemata` instance, a `GraphQLSchema` object or even an `ASTNode`. Of course, basic strings of SDL can also be used.

An object with resolver functions can be supplied as the second parameter allowing executable schemas to be generated from the source SDL.

The final two parameters are for the case where the Schemata instance is initialized with a GraphQLSchema instance or with an older instance of Schemata.
- The first causes a programmatic attempt to generate and set an object containing resolvers from the executable schema represented by either eligible object.
- The second causes the generated resolver map to be in the flattened style with root fields exposed at the root of the resolver map. By default the Apollo style resolver map with fields under their respective type names is the default

In the case where Schemata instance was created with a GraphQLSchema, especially one that is an executableSchema or somehow has resolvers in it already, `buildResolvers()` will walk the schema fields and build up a resolvers object of those `resolve()` functions on each field. If true is supplied as the first parameter, the resolver functions from Query, Mutation and Subscription will appear in the root of the returned object rather than under their aforementioned parent types.

```js
mergeSDL(

```

Given a string of Schema Definition Language (or SDL) or a Schemata instance itself or any of the other initialization sources, the function will proceed to blend the derived SDL with the one of the instance. In the case of conflicts, either the default resolver, which simply takes the newer right hand value, or a function of your own devising will be called to decide. See the [`ConflictResolvers`](#type-conflict-resolvers) type for more info

Given a string of Schema Definition Language (or SDL) or a Schemata instance itself or any of the other initialization sources, the function will proceed to remove the items using the derived SDL as a guide. If the internal instance has resolvers set or one can be built from the Schema stored on the instance, or if a set is supplied as the second parameter, the resolvers will also be pared down for any removed types and fields. Types stripped of all fields will themselves be removed.

This process stores the resolvers of the internal schema as well as those of the supplied schema. The supplied schema is then converted to Schemata and the mergeSDL() function is applied. Post merge, the previously stored and merged resolvers map are are applied and a new executable schema is built from the ashes of the old. See the [`ConflictResolvers`](#type-conflict-resolvers) type for more info

Using the Facebook reference implementation's call to `buildSchema()` is made. If an error is thrown and `showError` is not true, the exception will be swallowed and null will be returned instead.
schemaOpts is the optional second parameter taken by `require('graphql').buildSchema()`

#### <a name="fn-parse"></a>parse [✯](#contents)
```js
static parse(
  sdl: string | Schemata | Source | GraphQLSchema,
  showError: boolean = false
): ?ASTNode
```
Using the Facebook reference implementation's call to `parse()` is made. The resulting `AstNode` objects will be returned. If the `sdl` is not valid, an error will be thrown if showError is truthy

#### <a name="fn-print"></a>print [✯](#contents)
```js
static print(
  ast: ASTNode,
  showError: boolean = false
): ?Schemata
```
A little wrapper used to catch any errors thrown when printing an ASTNode
to string form using `require('graphql').print()`. If `showError` is true
any thrown errors will be rethrown, otherwise null is returned instead.
Should all go as planned, an instance of Schemata wrapped with the printed
SDL will be returned.

*Since version 1.7*

#### <a name="type-union-merge-resolver"></a>UnionMergeResolver [✯](#contents)
```js
export type UnionMergeResolver = (
  leftType: ASTNode,
  leftUnion: NamedTypeNode,
  rightType: ASTNode,

) => GraphQLScalarTypeConfig
```
The `ScalarMergeResolver` is a function that takes both left and right scalars that are colliding and their custom resolver configs *if available*. Scalars definitions are a not always available, but if they are they will be provided. Therefore the default resolver for custom scalars will take whichever `GraphQLScalarTypeConfig` object is availabe starting with right, moving to left and then null.

```js
export function runInjectors(
  config: MergeOptionsConfig,
  resolverArgs: ResolverArgs
): ResolverArgs
```
Given an initial set of arguments passed to a resolver function and a [`MergeOptionsConfig`](#type-merge-options-config) setup, it generates a new set of [`ResolverArgs`](#type-resolver-args) that, post-modification, can finally be passed to the resolver when wrapped.

```js
export function SchemaInjectorConfig(
  schema: GraphQLSchema,
  extraConfig?: MergeOptionsConfig
): MergeOptionsConfig
```
The merge options config takes the arguments passed into a given `resolve()` function, allowing the implementor to modify the values before passing them back out.

This function takes a schema to inject into the info object, or fourth parameter, passed to any resolver. Any `extraConfig` object added in will have its resolverInjectors added to the list to be processed.
